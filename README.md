# ATLAS Analysis: Additional Scalar decay via dark vector bosons to a 4-lepton plus MET final state
This repository contains
- Generation code: generates specific particle decays using the Monte Carlo method
- Analysis code: evaluates the generated events, storing data in .root files and creating plots

All code is intended to be run on lxplus, the remote computing service for CERN. This requires ssh and a CERN account.
Generation and Analysis are run separately and each may contain sub-folders with different code that is run separately for different occasions.
More detailed instructions on how to run the code is found in the subfolders.

Languages used:
 - Generation: ROOT, C++, Python, Shell, MadGraph, Pythia
 - Analysis: ROOT, C++, Python, Shell
(What versions??)
