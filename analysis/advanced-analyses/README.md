## mH-scaling/
Investigates H>2S>4Zd>4l+MET decays over multiple mH masses, scaling all histograms acc. to an mH-specific normalization factor

- crystal-ball-fits/
    - Generates normalization factors by fitting a double-sided crystal ball function to non-resonant di-Higgs data
- scale_All.cpp - scales kinematics acc. to normalization factors, saves to .root file
